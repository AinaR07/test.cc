## Code modification
This repository contains a rice cooker simulation with features for adding rice, cooking rice, steaming rice, keeping rice warm, and removing rice from the cooker.

## Changes made
The original code was based on if/else if statements to handle user choices. Here are the main changes made:

### 1.Integration of the switch case structure: 
if/else if statements have been replaced by a switch case structure. This makes the code easier to read and more efficient in managing the various user options.

### 2.Refactoring for the use of modules: 
Imports and exports have been configured to use ES6 modules, enabling better code structuring.

### 3.Potential bugs fixed: 
The menu.js file is imported to display the menu, and minor adjustments have been made to ensure that functions are correctly called.
N.B: you'll also need Ny Ando Mayah's "menu.js
## Code usage
The main file is main.js. To run it, make sure you have Node.js installed. Use the node main.js command in your terminal to start the rice cooker simulation. Follow the instructions displayed to interact with the simulator.

## Note
Be sure to install the necessary dependencies by running npm install to obtain the required packages, including prompt-sync for user input management.
